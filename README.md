# Simple 2D tower defense game for academic project.

To compile this project you need to download 32bit SFML-2.3.2 version for your compiler from [SFML site](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.3.2/).

For Visual Studio put your sfml file to `C:\SFML`, proper directores should be:

lib files `C:\SFML\SFML-2.3.2\lib`  
include files (SFML folder) `C:\SFML\SFML-2.3.2\include`

For others IDE/compilators you need to properly link sfml.


To run this game you need to copy-paste both dll files from Sfml bin folder to your exe folder and Resource folder from tower defense folder.
